# 📘 TFM — Working Memory & ANN Interpretability

This repository contains the code and analysis developed for my Master’s Thesis (TFM) on **Working Memory**, **neural data analysis**, and **interpretability of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**.  
The project is organized into three main components:

- **Exploratory Analysis**  
- **Generalized Linear Models (GLM)**  
- **Neural Networks (NN)**  

Each component corresponds to a different stage of the analysis pipeline.

## 🧬 Data Source

The dataset used in this project comes from the study:

**Pani, P., et al. (2023).**  
*Working memory representations in human cortex during delay periods.*  
Cortex.  
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2023.10.019

The data were collected using intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings during a working‑memory task involving Baseline, Sensory, and Delay periods.  
All analyses in this repository are based on the dataset provided in that publication.

## 🔍 1. Exploratory Analysis

This folder contains scripts used to:

- Inspect the dataset  
- Visualize distributions and correlations  
- Explore channel activity across conditions  
- Identify patterns that guide model selection  

**File:**  
- `Exploratory analysis.R` — first-pass exploration of the dataset.

---

## 📊 2. GLM (Generalized Linear Models)

This section includes models used to quantify the relationship between neural activity and experimental conditions (Baseline, Delay, Sensory).

**File:**  
- `BSL, DELAY & SENS subject model.R` — GLM implementation for subject-level analysis.

---

## 🧠 3. Neural Networks (NN)

This folder will contain:

- ANN architectures  
- Training scripts  
- Interpretability analyses (e.g., saliency maps, feature importance)  

Currently empty — models will be added as the project progresses.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Understand neural dynamics underlying working memory  
- Compare classical statistical models (GLM) with ANN-based approaches  
- Apply interpretability techniques to neural networks  
- Evaluate model performance across cognitive conditions
